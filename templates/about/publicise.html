      Measure your snap&rsquo;s performance
    </h2>
    <p>To see how your snap is performing, go to the “Metrics” tab on your snap publishing pages. Here are the metrics available to you right now:</p>
    <h3 class="p-heading--4">
      Weekly active devices
    </h3>
    <p>
      As the name indicates, this graph shows you how many devices have used your snap over time. This is a good measure of how often your users engage with it.

    <h3 class="p-heading--4">Snap users by OS, channel or version</h3>
    <p>If you open the dropdown above this chart in the Metrics page, you will be able to select different options to segment your users. These include the OS they are running your snaps with, what channel they are using (stable, candidate, beta or edge) and what version of your software they are on. This will help you visualise the rhythm at which your software updates are being adopted.</p>
