      Release UI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Snapcraft allows you to release your snaps either by using the command line tool or the visual interface on our website. If you visit your snap page, you will find a “Release” tab in which you can see which version of your software is released to each channel and architecture. The UI is a simple drag-and-drop table where you can move around the revisions of your snap, until you’re happy, before committing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use our <a href="/build">build service</a> all revisions built at the same time will be tagged as a set, allowing you to work on related revisions easily. Built revisions will also automatically be released to the edge channel &mdash; no&dash;hassle continuous deployment.

      Announcing updates
    </h2>
    <p>
      Releasing your snap is only the first step - you also need to tell your users about it. On the <a href="/about/publicise">publicise page</a> there&rsquo;s information about badges and buttons you can use to help promote and inform users about your snap and it&rsquo;s status. We provide a badge that appears when your snap is trending on the Store to show visitors to your site that your snap is something to take a look at.
