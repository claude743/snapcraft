name: |
  The name must be unique in the Snap Store. Valid snap names consist of at
  least two lower-case alphanumeric characters and can contain hyphens.
  They cannot consist of only numbers and cannot start or end with a hyphen.
version: |
  The version is a string that is assigned to the project by its developers,
  according to their development practices. It is a free text field that should
  be human readable and tell the user what content to expect from a snap.
summary: |
  A sentence summarising the snap in short and simple terms.
description: |
  A multi-line description of the snap. This should be a more in-depth look at
  what your snap does and who may find it most useful.
confinement: |
  Confinement determines if the snap should be restricted in access or not.
  Possible values are <b>strict</b> (for no access outside of declared interfaces through plugs),
  <b>devmode</b> (for unrestricted access) or <b>classic</b>.
base: |
  A base is a special kind of snap that provides a minimal set of libraries
  common to most applications. A base snap mounts itself as the root filesystem
  within your snap so that when your application runs, the baseâ€™s library paths
  are searched directly after the paths for your specific snap.
parts: |
  Parts are a set of building blocks which are usually independent. These
  building blocks consist of either code, pre-built packages or other assets.
  At times some blocks depend on another and as such may be built in a defined
  sequence.
apps: |
  A map of app-names representing entry points to run for the snap.
